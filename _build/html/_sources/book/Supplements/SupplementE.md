Understand what you are annotating – do not automatically assume what an acronym, word or phrase means in the article. Terms that look like they should be in a particular hierarchy or related to certain terms may represent completely different concepts. If uncertain, check the original article (if full-text is available). And match with NALT preferred or entry-level terms and definitions.

    "### Assignment of geographical descriptors - Summary\n",
    "1. Do not assign geographical descriptors based solely on those terms in the common or taxonomic names of strains of bacteria and other organisms. (e.g., Newcastle disease, Egypt bee virus).\n",
    "2. The geographical origin of a strain or line can be used even if the work is done in vitro (e.g., supporting epidemiological studies of disease outbreaks). \n",
    "3. For articles in which subjects (animals, plants, humans) migrate/invade or are imported/introduced from one country/area and studied in another, apply a geographical descriptor for the country where the subjects were studied and indicate their geographical origin, if appropriate. This applies only to living subjects studied in a natural environment (e.g., not laboratory/captive animals or museum specimens).\n",
    "4. Do not assign geographical terms based solely on author affiliation or journal name.\n",
    "5. Do not add geographical descriptors for laboratory or greenhouse studies, unless done as comparison to field studies. \n",
    "6. There is no limit to the number of geographical descriptors that may be used. However, in most cases where more than five or six are applicable, it may make more sense to use a broader geographical term that subsumes the others. \n",
    "7. Do not use historical geographic locations for current research or discussion. \n",
    "8. If more than four continents (e.g., Asia, Europe, Africa, South America, North America) are mentioned but no narrower concepts are discussed, omit them.\n",
    "9. Confirm the location of place names not in the *NALT*.\n",

Hispanic refers to people who speak Spanish or are descended from Spanish-speaking populations (includes Spain) and is generally self-reported.

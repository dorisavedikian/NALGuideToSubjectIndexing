# # Basic Indexing Guidelines
# 
# 1.)	Determine what you are indexing (*“indexing”* or *“annotating”*) based on the title, journal name and abstract (*“article”*). 
# 
# 2.)	The NAL thesaurus (*“NALT”*) is the sole source for annotations, with concepts being added, modified, defined, redefined and deprecated, as needed. 
# 
# 3.)	All articles must have at least three concepts to be processed. While there is no upper limit, that does not mean that every possible concept must be added. 
# 
# 4.)	Look for the “magic sentence” when the author(s) (*“author”*) starts talking about what they are doing and/or will be describing in the article. Do not index what has been done in the past, will be done in the future or is mentioned as background information or speculation. 
# 
# 5.)	Be aware that similar phrases or related concepts/terms (*“RTs”*) have different meanings and hierarchies. Review definitions, scope notes, Broader Concepts/Terms (*“BTs”*), Narrower Concepts/Terms (*“NTs”*), and Entry-Level (or hidden/alternate) Terms to ensure that you are selecting the appropriate concept(s). 
# 
# 6.)	Do not fixate on a term. Do not add concepts merely because they are in the title, journal name and/or article. Determine whether the concept is relevant to the article and is the best term to cover what the author is discussing or doing. 
# 
# 7.)	The broadest, top-level concepts should not be used if narrower concepts are applicable and/or there are more than three concepts. 
# 
# 8.)	Use the narrowest concept possible but only if it describes the entire article and does not omit equal concept(s) not captured by a *NALT* concept. 
# 
# 9.)	Review annotated concepts to determine if all are necessary or better ones come to mind.

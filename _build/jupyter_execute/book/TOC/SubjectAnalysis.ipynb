    "## Basics for Using Taxonomic Names\n",
    "\n",
    "(see [Supplement C](SuppC) for a summary of this section)\n",
    "\n",
    "Check taxonomy names carefully. Research anything that is not clear and/or listed in NALT; search multiple relevant databases and websites, if needed (see [Supplement B](SupplementB)). \n",
    "\n",
    "For new species (or genus, family, etc.), ensure that taxonomic name does not already exist as an entry-level term. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure any taxonomic names are valid and have not been superseded. If a name has changed, annotate the existing _NALT_ concept (e.g., species, genus) and submit the new name and any supporting documentation; see [NAL Thesaurus](NAL). \n",
    "*\tThe article “Response of mycorrhizal symbiosis to phosphorus and its application for sustainable crop production and remediation of environment”{cite}`Keitaro` refers to the fungus _Rhizophagus clarus. R. clarus_ is not listed in _NALT_ but several taxonomic databases (e.g., GBIF, MycoBank) indicate that the NALT term _Glomus clarum_ is a basionym for _R. clarus._ \n",
    "\n",
    "For varieties of the same species, ensure that you are selecting the correct term.\n",
    "*\tFor “Terpenoids from _Nardostachys jatamansi_ and their cytotoxic activity against human pancreatic cancer cell lines”{cite}`MA2022`, _NALT_ contains two different terms for _N. jatamansi: N. jatamansi (Jones ex Roxb.) DC._ (preferred label __Valeriana jatamansi__) AND _N. jatamansi auct._ (preferred label __Nardostachys grandiflora__). The first sentence of the article indicates which one is being described, _“Nardostachys jatamansi DC._ (Valerianaceae) (Chauhan et al., 2008) is an endangered and perennial distributed in the alpine region ...”\n",
    "\n",
    "Taxonomic names may be changed on some platforms but not all. Annotate the existing NALT concept and submit the new name and supporting documentation.\n",
    "* For “Physicochemical properties and volatile profile of mung bean flour fermented by _Lacticaseibacillus casei_ and _Lactococcus lactis_”{cite}`GIANGRIECO2022`, __L. lactis__ is in NALT but _L. casei_ is not. Per Wikipedia, _“Lacticaseibacillus casei_ is an organism that belongs to the largest genus in the family _Lactobacillaceae_, a lactic acid bacteria (LAB), that was previously classified as Lactobacillus casei ...”. Per https://www.optibacprobiotics.com, this change was made in 2020 so it may not be recognized on all platforms yet. \n",
    "\n",
    "Do not mix up the same or similar words in different levels and hierarchies. \n",
    "*\t__Pachystigma (genus)__ vs. __Cuscuta L. subgenus Pachystigma__\n",
    "*\t__Oocystis__ vs. __oocysts__\n",
    "*\t__Tilapia (*Cichlidae*)__ vs __tilapia (common name)__\n",
    "*\tGenus name used as a common name to describe another genus/species: “Effect of dietary Spirulina (_Arthrospira platensis_) on the intestinal function of post-weaned piglet: An approach combining proteomics, metabolomics and histological studies”{cite}`MARTINS2022`. In NALT, A. __platensis__ includes __Spirulina jenneri var. platensis__ and __S. platensis__ as entry-level terms. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "For scientific names (“taxonomic name”), use the highest level of specificity available in _NALT_. This might be order, family, genus, or species.  Standards and guidance are provided below by general organism type.\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases where the use of a taxonomic name is required but is not available in the article, search AGRICOLA or other resources (see Supplement B).  Common or group names (“common name”) can be highly variable and often very localized so the taxonomic name may not be obvious. If the common name is not in NALT, check the full-text article to see if the author provides the taxonomy and/or alternate common names. If the species name is not in NALT, use the genus. If the genus is not available, use the family name and so on. If an indexer cannot trace the taxonomic name at any level in the taxonomic hierarchy with some degree of certainty and within a reasonable period of time (i.e., 5-10 minutes), it may be necessary to assign a role or context term (“role/context”) to convey the intended topic.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Not all full taxonomic names (i.e., genus and species) have a common name associated with them in NALT and vice versa. If there is ambiguity about what the organism is (e.g., common beans), confirm the taxonomic or common name in the full article. Ensure you are annotating the correct common or taxonomic name based on the organism being described (e.g., __rats__ versus __mole rats__ versus __kangaroo rats__ [preferred term __*Dipodomys*__]).\n",
    "\n",
    "If a role/context is an RT of the organism(s) or product(s), it may be assigned if it is relevant to the entire article and not just mentioned as an aside. See the examples for each organism listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Select the appropriate level of specificity for the common name or role/context. If uncertain, check the taxonomic name to determine the appropriate term(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "Articles less than one page on insect or plant taxonomy and nomenclature as well as new cultivar and germplasm registrations are indexed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q)\tPlants\n",
    "1. Index the taxonomic name for the plant specified in the article. If the author uses a different taxonomic name other than what is listed in NALT, but which is also a valid preferred term for the plant, use that term. \n",
    "    1.\tExample: for __tomatoes__, the preferred NALT term is __*Solanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum*__ but many authors use Solanum lycopersicum. Per Germplasm Resource Information Network (GRIN), both are acceptable but other taxonomic databases consider only _S. lycopersicum_ valid and _S. lycopersicum var. lycopersicum_ as invalid.\n",
    "2. Add the common name, if available. Check the RT relationship in _NALT_ for the commodity or product name. See [Supplement C](SuppC) for guidance on when to include both the taxonomic and common names and when to annotate only one.\n",
    "    1.\tFor \"Transcriptome Response of Maize (Zea Mays L.) Seedlings to Heat Stress,\"{cite}`Zhong`, __corn__ and __*Zea mays*__ should be annotated. \n",
    "    2.\tFor \"The Recent Occurrence of Biotic Postharvest Diseases of Apples In Poland”{cite}`agronomy`, __apples__ should be annotated but not __*Malus domestica*__. \n",
    "3. Consider annotating the role/context of the plant (e.g., __weeds, medicinal plants, poisonous plants, conservation plants,__ etc.) if it is the focus of the research or discussion, not just mentioned in passing.  Check the __plants__ hierarchy to find the appropriate term(s).\n",
    "    1.\t“Growing dandelions for food and profit” would include the terms __*Taraxacum officiale*__ and __food crops__, but “Control of dandelions in turfgrass” would include __*Taraxacum officiale*__ and __weeds.__\n",

    "### Assignment of geographical descriptors - Summary\n",
    "1. Do not assign geographical descriptors based solely on those terms in the common or taxonomic names of strains of bacteria and other organisms. (e.g., Newcastle disease, Egypt bee virus).\n",
    "2. The geographical origin of a strain or line can be used even if the work is done in vitro (e.g., supporting epidemiological studies of disease outbreaks). \n",
    "3. For articles in which subjects (animals, plants, humans) migrate/invade or are imported/introduced from one country/area and studied in another, apply a geographical descriptor for the country where the subjects were studied and indicate their geographical origin, if appropriate. This applies only to living subjects studied in a natural environment (e.g., not laboratory/captive animals or museum specimens).\n",
    "4. Do not assign geographical terms based solely on author affiliation or journal name.\n",
    "5. Do not add geographical descriptors for laboratory or greenhouse studies, unless done as comparison to field studies. \n",
    "6. There is no limit to the number of geographical descriptors that may be used. However, in most cases where more than five or six are applicable, it may make more sense to use a broader geographical term that subsumes the others. \n",
    "7. Do not use historical geographic locations for current research or discussion. \n",
    "8. If more than four continents (e.g., Asia, Europe, Africa, South America, North America) are mentioned but no narrower concepts are discussed, omit them.\n",
    "9. Confirm the location of place names not in the NALT.\n",

# ## Methodology and Techniques
# 
# Things to consider: 
# *	What is the method/technique (“method”) being discussed?
# *	Is the method the primary (or one of the primary) concept in the article or just mentioned as a routine part of the process?
# *	Is the method analytical, statistical, computational, role-based, discipline-based, etc.?
# *	Are steps and/or equipment described in detail for doing the analysis?
# *	Is different equipment using the same method being compared?
# *	If more than one method is discussed, is a comparison being done between the two, e.g., one is more accurate, one is easier to do than the other?
# *	Is the method important to or for reaching the conclusion?
# 
# <u> When methodology or technique terms <b>should</b> be selected for indexing </u>
# 
# Check the full-text article (if available) to determine if the method or technique is described more in detail or is only listed once or a few times in explaining the experiment or research.
# 
# If a methodology topic is a primary focus of the research project, index it.  This includes:
# *	New methodology 
#     *	“The study focuses on the development of a new procedure for the preparation of reference samples with a given concentration for X-ray fluorescence analysis ...”{cite}`SVERCHKOV` 
# *	Analytical methods are the focus of the article/research
#     *	“...In this review, the analytical methods of PAHs in sediment, focused on the methods of sample extraction, purification, concentration and determination, are summarized.”{cite}`WU2019`  
# *	Research includes improving a known methodology
# *	Methodology is used in a new or different way
# *	Methodology is evaluated for accuracy or reliability
# *	Two or more methods are being evaluated
# 
# Consider indexing methodology if: 
# *	it provides a unique or characteristic mechanism for studying or evaluating the primary topic
#     *	“...presents the advantages of microextraction to encourage the use of this technique in microbial analysis ..."{cite}`BELINATO2021`  
# *	helps to describe the nature of the results.
#     *	If an article is about the isolation, purification or fractionation of a mixture of compounds, __high performance liquid chromatography__ might describe more precisely what kind of “isolation” is involved.
# 
# An article about determining of the structure of a chemical compound by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy needs <u>both</u> __chemical structure__ (or appropriate NT) and by __nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy__ annotated because a user trying to determine the structure of a new compound by nuclear magnetic resonance would want to compare the spectral data of the new compound to the one in the article.
# 
# An article showing determination of the ultrastructure of a biochemical compound by X-ray diffraction gives different data than one using scanning electron microscopy.  Users might need to know the technique used to determine the ultrastructure.
# 
# An article about the effect of nutrient intake on some biochemical parameter or disease condition is best described by adding the method of data collection, e.g., epidemiological survey, dietary survey or clinical trial. While the article does not focus on the survey technique, including these topics may help to describe what the article is about.
# 	
# <u>When the methodology or technique topics <b>should not</b> be selected for indexing</u>
# 
# Do not select the methodology or technique routinely if it is not the main topics discussed (“aboutness”). Is the article about this method or is it only mentioned as the technique the author used to do his research? Is the “how we do it” as important as “what are we trying to determine”? Consider whether or not a user would benefit from being able to retrieve that article using that descriptor. 
#   *	“The fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith), is one of the most highly polyphagous invasive pests … However, little is known about the gut immune responses to the environment, particularly along the migration routes in Jianghuai, China, throughout the autumn and winter. In this study, high-throughput sequencing and real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) were employed to examine the variations in immune genes and gut microbiome communities between captive and wild fall armyworm populations ...”{cite}`ZHENG2023` - __quantitative polymerase chain reaction and high-throughput nucleotide sequencing__ are not necessary because it only describes how samples are processed. 
# 
# Some research articles give the details of the stepwise procedure of the overall analysis, such as collection of leaves, drying of leaves, milling of leaves, acid digestion of leaves, etc.  Do not index the individual stepwise procedures. 
# 
# ## Basics for Using Taxonomic Names
# 
# (see [Supplement C](SuppC) for a summary of this section)
# 
# Check taxonomy names carefully. Research anything that is not clear and/or listed in NALT; search multiple relevant databases and websites, if needed (see [Supplement B](SupplementB)). 
# 
# For new species (or genus, family, etc.), ensure that taxonomic name does not already exist as an entry-level term. 
# 
# Ensure any taxonomic names are valid and have not been superseded. If a name has changed, annotate the existing _NALT_ concept (e.g., species, genus) and submit the new name and any supporting documentation; see [NAL Thesaurus](NAL). 
# *	The article “Response of mycorrhizal symbiosis to phosphorus and its application for sustainable crop production and remediation of environment”{cite}`Keitaro` refers to the fungus _Rhizophagus clarus. R. clarus_ is not listed in _NALT_ but several taxonomic databases (e.g., GBIF, MycoBank) indicate that the NALT term _Glomus clarum_ is a basionym for _R. clarus._ 
# 
# For varieties of the same species, ensure that you are selecting the correct term.
# *	For “Terpenoids from _Nardostachys jatamansi_ and their cytotoxic activity against human pancreatic cancer cell lines”{cite}`MA2022`, _NALT_ contains two different terms for _N. jatamansi: N. jatamansi (Jones ex Roxb.) DC._ (preferred label __Valeriana jatamansi__) AND _N. jatamansi auct._ (preferred label __Nardostachys grandiflora__). The first sentence of the article indicates which one is being described, _“Nardostachys jatamansi DC._ (Valerianaceae) (Chauhan et al., 2008) is an endangered and perennial distributed in the alpine region ...”
# 
# Taxonomic names may be changed on some platforms but not all. Annotate the existing NALT concept and submit the new name and supporting documentation.
# * For “Physicochemical properties and volatile profile of mung bean flour fermented by _Lacticaseibacillus casei_ and _Lactococcus lactis_”{cite}`GIANGRIECO2022`, __L. lactis__ is in NALT but _L. casei_ is not. Per Wikipedia, _“Lacticaseibacillus casei_ is an organism that belongs to the largest genus in the family _Lactobacillaceae_, a lactic acid bacteria (LAB), that was previously classified as Lactobacillus casei ...”. Per https://www.optibacprobiotics.com, this change was made in 2020 so it may not be recognized on all platforms yet. 
# 
# Do not mix up the same or similar words in different levels and hierarchies. 
# *	__Pachystigma (genus)__ vs. __Cuscuta L. subgenus Pachystigma__
# *	__Oocystis__ vs. __oocysts__
# *	__Tilapia (*Cichlidae*)__ vs __tilapia (common name)__
# *	Genus name used as a common name to describe another genus/species: “Effect of dietary Spirulina (_Arthrospira platensis_) on the intestinal function of post-weaned piglet: An approach combining proteomics, metabolomics and histological studies”{cite}`MARTINS2022`. In NALT, A. __platensis__ includes __Spirulina jenneri var. platensis__ and __S. platensis__ as entry-level terms. 
# 
# 
# ### General Considerations
# 
# For scientific names (“taxonomic name”), use the highest level of specificity available in _NALT_. This might be order, family, genus, or species.  Standards and guidance are provided below by general organism type.
# 
# In cases where the use of a taxonomic name is required but is not available in the article, search AGRICOLA or other resources (see Supplement B).  Common or group names (“common name”) can be highly variable and often very localized so the taxonomic name may not be obvious. If the common name is not in NALT, check the full-text article to see if the author provides the taxonomy and/or alternate common names. If the species name is not in NALT, use the genus. If the genus is not available, use the family name and so on. If an indexer cannot trace the taxonomic name at any level in the taxonomic hierarchy with some degree of certainty and within a reasonable period of time (i.e., 5-10 minutes), it may be necessary to assign a role or context term (“role/context”) to convey the intended topic.  
# 
# Not all full taxonomic names (i.e., genus and species) have a common name associated with them in NALT and vice versa. If there is ambiguity about what the organism is (e.g., common beans), confirm the taxonomic or common name in the full article. Ensure you are annotating the correct common or taxonomic name based on the organism being described (e.g., __rats__ versus __mole rats__ versus __kangaroo rats__ [preferred term __*Dipodomys*__]).
# 
# If a role/context is an RT of the organism(s) or product(s), it may be assigned if it is relevant to the entire article and not just mentioned as an aside. See the examples for each organism listed below.
# 
# Select the appropriate level of specificity for the common name or role/context. If uncertain, check the taxonomic name to determine the appropriate term(s).
# 
# Articles less than one page on insect or plant taxonomy and nomenclature as well as new cultivar and germplasm registrations are indexed.
# 
# #### Q)	Plants
# 1. Index the taxonomic name for the plant specified in the article. If the author uses a different taxonomic name other than what is listed in NALT, but which is also a valid preferred term for the plant, use that term. 
#     1.	Example: for __tomatoes__, the preferred NALT term is __*Solanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum*__ but many authors use Solanum lycopersicum. Per Germplasm Resource Information Network (GRIN), both are acceptable but other taxonomic databases consider only _S. lycopersicum_ valid and _S. lycopersicum var. lycopersicum_ as invalid.
# 2. Add the common name, if available. Check the RT relationship in _NALT_ for the commodity or product name. See [Supplement C](SuppC) for guidance on when to include both the taxonomic and common names and when to annotate only one.
#     1.	For "Transcriptome Response of Maize (Zea Mays L.) Seedlings to Heat Stress,"{cite}`Zhong`, __corn__ and __*Zea mays*__ should be annotated. 
#     2.	For "The Recent Occurrence of Biotic Postharvest Diseases of Apples In Poland”{cite}`agronomy`, __apples__ should be annotated but not __*Malus domestica*__. 
# 3. Consider annotating the role/context of the plant (e.g., __weeds, medicinal plants, poisonous plants, conservation plants,__ etc.) if it is the focus of the research or discussion, not just mentioned in passing.  Check the __plants__ hierarchy to find the appropriate term(s).
#     1.	“Growing dandelions for food and profit” would include the terms __*Taraxacum officiale*__ and __food crops__, but “Control of dandelions in turfgrass” would include __*Taraxacum officiale*__ and __weeds.__
#     2.	"...We evaluated use of the insectary plant _Cnidium monnieri_ (L.) Cuss. to increase the diversity and population density of natural enemies, promote the movement of natural enemies, and improve suppression of the spirea aphid (_Aphis spiraecola_ Patch){cite}`CAI2021`... _C. monnieri_ can foster predatory natural enemies, such as _Propylaea japonica, Harmonia axyridis, Hippodamia variegata, Chrysoperla sinica,_ and _Episyrphus balteata_...”. Annotate _Cnidium monnieri, Aphis spiraecola, Malus domestica, Propylea_ (NOTE – misspelled in the article), _Harmonia axyridis, Hippodamia variegata, Chrysoperla, Episyrphus,_ natural enemies and insectary plants. 
# 
# 
# #### R)	Plant products
# 1.	Use the commodity/product name of the plant if it is available as a term and the article discusses the postharvest use, commercial processing and/or consumption of the plant.
#     1.	Example: Texture of cooked carrots after frozen storage is indexed as **carrots**.  Do not assign __*Daucus carota*__.
# 2.	Consider annotating the role/context of the plant product, (e.g., __chilled foods, convenience foods, textile fibers,__ or __stored products__) if it is the focus of the research or discussion, not just mentioned in passing. Check the __agricultural products__ and/or __nonfood products__ hierarchies to find the appropriate term(s).

#     1.	For “Intraocular pressure of mature loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) held in various positions”, __*Caretta caretta*__ and __sea turtles__.  It is not necessary to convey the role/context of the turtle because it’s not a key topic, but __animal physiology__ or one of its NTs is a possibility.
#     2.	However, an article with the title “South East Asia’s vanishing turtles” would be indexed with the taxonomic name(s) as needed, ___turtles__ and __endangered species.__
# 
# #### BB)	Mammals and Birds (not as livestock, experimental animals, or pets)

# 
# ### 4.1.1.e - Use of terms for diseases and experimental animal models
# A primary consideration in this section are indexing practices that will recognize the relationship(s) between the host organism, the disease organism and the resulting disease.  Unless noted, in the circumstances below, the specificity of terms will be assigned as described under Section 4.1.1.b – Specificity.
# 
# #### EE)	Animal models

#     3.	For “Brucella abortus infection in cattle”, include __bovine brucellosis__ and __Brucella abortus__, but not __cattle diseases__ since __bovine brucellosis__ is one of its NTs.
# 
# #### GG)	Plant diseases
# 1.	Index diseases in plants with the appropriate term for the disease from the __plant diseases and disorders__ hierarchy.  Note that several terms can be used for one article, e.g., __tree diseases__ and __root diseases.__

#     1.	__ratoon stunting disease__, RT __Leifsonia xyli subsp. xyli__
#     2.	__Taro bacilliform virus__, RT __Planococcus citri__
# 3.	Consider annotating the role/context of the infecting organism (e.g., __plant parasitic nematodes, plant viruses,__ etc.) if it is the focus of the research or discussion, not just mentioned in passing. Check the __plant diseases and disorders, parasites,__ and/or __plant pathogens__ hierarchies for the appropriate term(s)
#     1.	For “Phytophthora cinnamomi root rot as a cause of oak mortality”, include __Phytophthora cinnamomi, tree diseases__ and __root rot.__

# 
# ### Assignment of terms - Summary
# *	Check taxonomic and common names carefully to ensure you are annotating the correct ones that correspond with the organism described in the article. 
# *	Assign terms for organisms and products based on their role/context if that is the focus of the research or discussion, not just mentioned in passing.
# * Assign terms in a manner that is consistent with their hierarchies, RTs, definitions and scope notes.
# * If the articles equally covers more than three species (or genus, etc.) under one genus (or family, etc.), use the genus (or family, etc.) name. 
# * Assign terms for diseases (human, animal and plant) and experimental animal models according to the sections on <u>Use of terms for diseases</u> and <u>Use of terms for experimental animal models</u>.
# 
# ## Geographic Descriptors
# Include geographical terms under these circumstances:
# *	there is a specific geographic location in the title
# *	the article contains maps of specific geographic area(s)
# *	a specific area has been surveyed
# *	field research has been or is being done
# *	flora or fauna of a region has been or is being studied
# *	new taxa or other taxonomic information (e.g., ecological invasion, geographical distribution) are described
# *	specific organizations or institutions are the primary topic {cite}`f` 
# 
# Consider including geographical topics for articles with these subjects:
# *	ecology, including pollution
# *	economics
# *	education/training
# *	epidemiology
# *	history/paleontology/archaeology
# *	human ecology
# *	land and/or water resources
# *	legislation, jurisprudence or politics
# *	meteorology/climatology
# *	sociology
# 
# Geographical terms should be added for living subjects studied in the natural environment or specimens collected in one country and studied or held in another. 
#   *	A study about food habits of Salvadorans living in Manhattan would be assigned New York and Hispanics {cite}`f` as descriptors.  
#   *	An article about insects collected in Ghana but studied at an ARS laboratory in Maryland would be assigned Ghana (but not Maryland).
#   *	An article about captive lions in an American zoo would not be assigned a geographic term. The zoo’s location may be included if it is relevant to the entire article. 
# 
# Some countries, states and regions have narrower or related concepts. It may be necessary to research which term is the correct one(s) to annotate. 
#  *	“In 2019, leaves with anthracnose symptoms were observed on pitcher plants (Sarracenia purpurea subsp. purpurea f. heterophylla) in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan...”{cite}`f` Okinawa is an entry-level term for Ryukyu Archipelago, an NT of Japan. 
#  *	“...we develop a novel semi‐quantitative metabarcoding approach that combines specimen counts and size‐sorting to characterize arthropod community‐level diversity patterns along elevational transects on two different volcanoes of the island of Hawai‘i...”{cite}`f`. The study is being done specifically on Hawaii (island), not across multiple islands of Hawaii.
#  *	"Losses of C and N from the forest floor and top 20-cm of soil were estimated following separate severe wildfires at two Long-Term Soil Productivity sites in the Sierra Nevada of California, USA. Experimental treatments applied 20 years prior to the wildfires..."{cite}`f`v Since they are related (not BT-NT),  both California and Sierra Nevada (California) can be annotated. See discussion below on Named Geographical Regions. 
# 
# Do not assume that a cardinal direction is part of an official state, territory or country name and not just indicating a part of the state, territory or country. If the study area is not clear in the abstract, check the full text for any maps or descriptions. 
#  *	“...we present and examine a relatively dense network of wood property chronologies...from several species in Tasmania, southern Australia...”{cite}`f`
#  *	"... Our study area consisted of 26 sites in western Virginia within the Blue Ridge, Ridge and Valley, and Appalachian Plateau physiographic provinces, extending from Highland County in the north to Lee County in the southwest...”{cite}`f` Maps in the full text articles confirm the study area is in the southwestern corner of Virginia. 
#  *	"...The South African soil data, together with the SOTER data of Angola, Botswana, eSwatini (previously Swaziland), Namibia, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe formed the SOTERSAF database..."{cite}`f` A map showing the study area confirms it covers Angola, Botswana, eSwatini, Namibia, Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe so Southern Africa would be annotated. 
# 
# If they are specifically mentioned in the article, Named Geographical Regions may be annotated alongside country/state names, particularly those comprising a large area covering several countries, states or bodies of water; denoting a particular area of a country or continent; and/or representing an environment different (e.g., climatically, geomorphologically, culturally) from other parts of that country or state. 
#  *	Amazonia
#  *	El Gran Chaco
#  *	Himalayan region
#  * Maghreb
#  *	Pacific Rim
# 
# Confirm the correct location of all geographic names, especially those not in NALT, since some names are used in more than one country or location.

# Geographic place names may include landforms as part of the name. Consult NALT for the appropriate term to annotate. Do not include the landform as a separate term, unless it is relevant to the entire article’s subject. Note whether the landform starts with an upper or lower case letter and is a singular or plural form.

#  *	entry-level term Tibetan Plateau – preferred term China 
# 
# For articles discussing bodies of water, do not automatically add a descriptive place name(s) (e.g., state, country) in addition to the named body of water. Is the study area is in the water, on land next to the body of water or both? Determine if the place name is appropriate for the entire article or is merely describing where the body of water is. 
#  *	California – Gulf of California (in Mexico)
#  *	Chad – Lake Chad (in Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria)
#  *	Ohio – Ohio River (runs through Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Kentucky)
# 
# It is not necessary to include the name of the landform if it is part of an already-annotated preferred term, is not a significant concept in the article or would not provide any additional information. 
#  *	Black Hills National Forest
#  *	Colorado Desert 
#  *	Great Salt Lake

# ### Assignment of geographical descriptors - Summary
# 1. Do not assign geographical descriptors based solely on those terms in the common or taxonomic names of strains of bacteria and other organisms. (e.g., Newcastle disease, Egypt bee virus).
# 2. The geographical origin of a strain or line can be used even if the work is done in vitro (e.g., supporting epidemiological studies of disease outbreaks). 
# 3. For articles in which subjects (animals, plants, humans) migrate/invade or are imported/introduced from one country/area and studied in another, apply a geographical descriptor for the country where the subjects were studied and indicate their geographical origin, if appropriate. This applies only to living subjects studied in a natural environment (e.g., not laboratory/captive animals or museum specimens).
# 4. Do not assign geographical terms based solely on author affiliation or journal name.
# 5. Do not add geographical descriptors for laboratory or greenhouse studies, unless done as comparison to field studies. 
# 6. There is no limit to the number of geographical descriptors that may be used. However, in most cases where more than five or six are applicable, it may make more sense to use a broader geographical term that subsumes the others. 
# 7. Do not use historical geographic locations for current research or discussion. 
# 8. If more than four continents (e.g., Asia, Europe, Africa, South America, North America) are mentioned but no narrower concepts are discussed, omit them.
# 9. Confirm the location of place names not in the NALT.

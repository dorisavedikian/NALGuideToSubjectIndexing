    "Due to changes in the system being used to process records for Agricola/PubAg, everyone on the indexing team receives the same projects with the same articles but no terms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Everyone annotates the appropriate terms highlighting a word or phrase in the abstract and selecting the corresponding *NALT* concept, focusing on quality control (see [Subject Analysis](SA)). \n",
    "\n",
    "After everyone has completed the same project, that project and the individually-annotated terms will be consolidated into a single “Golden Set” project for a final review by the indexing team, who will (as a group) accept, reject, add and/or modify concepts. Terms (and how they are annotated) will be accepted based on the best match to the *NALT* concept. Whenever possible, terms will be accepted using the same highlighted word or phrase across all or most abstracts. \n",
    "\n",
    "If necessary, the team also determines whether an article meets the criteria for inclusion in Agricola (see [Supplement A](SupplementA)) or should be rejected and deleted from the Golden Set. \n",
    "\n",
    "The team will also consider highlighted annotations that are not currently in *NALT* as preferred or entry-level terms for addition to *NALT*. Candidate terms will be added to the CSE Resources for that project and will be categorized as such but will not be used to annotate other articles."

# Due to changes in the system being used to process records for Agricola/PubAg, everyone on the indexing team receives the same projects with the same articles but no terms. 
# 
# Everyone annotates the appropriate terms highlighting a word or phrase in the abstract and selecting the corresponding *NALT* concept, focusing on quality control (see [Subject Analysis](SA)). 
# 
# After everyone has completed the same project, that project and the individually-annotated terms will be consolidated into a single “Golden Set” project for a final review by the indexing team, who will (as a group) accept, reject, add and/or modify concepts. Terms (and how they are annotated) will be accepted based on the best match to the *NALT* concept. Whenever possible, terms will be accepted using the same highlighted word or phrase across all or most abstracts. 
# 
# If necessary, the team also determines whether an article meets the criteria for inclusion in Agricola (see [Supplement A](SupplementA)) or should be rejected and deleted from the Golden Set. 
# 
# The team will also consider highlighted annotations that are not currently in *NALT* as preferred or entry-level terms for addition to *NALT*. Candidate terms will be added to the CSE Resources for that project and will be categorized as such but will not be used to annotate other articles.

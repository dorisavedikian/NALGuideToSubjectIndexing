    "If you encounter a problem article in a project, research the issue (e.g., missing abstract; out of scope; mashed words or sentences; missing characters, words or sentences). Metadata comes from the publisher and must be ingested into CSE but it is not always correct. CSE sometimes mashes words together that are actually transitions between different sections of the abstract. As indicated previously, articles that are not “born digital” and have been scanned from a hard copy may not have gone through proper optical character recognition so text may not be processed correctly by CSE. In other cases, it is just a matter of our collection development policies. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the issue, check the original article for the same error; if the original article has the same problem, we do not correct many of those errors (e.g., misspellings, mashed words).  If not, search the journal title in that project for other articles from that journal that may have the same problem. Once you have confirmed all of the affected articles with the same journal name and problem in that project, then send the information (e.g., screenshots, list of AGID’s, PDF of full-text article, COGX file) to the IIB Lead.\n",

__Supplement F: Checklist of Common Indexing Errors__

It may be helpful to use this checklist to evaluate your own indexing. 

1.	Failing to annotate a significant concept.

    1.	Not annotating **hops** in “AHR agonistic effects of 6-PN contribute to potential beneficial effects of Hops extract”{cite}`ZANARDI2022`
        
    2.	Not annotating **rats** in “...This study assessed whether the ABP or fenofibrate administration for 28 days interferes in lipid, glucose, or inflammatory changes in the enterohepatic axis of rats fed HFD...”

    3.	Not annotating **antibiotic residues** in “To explore the responses of soil microbial communities to concentration gradients of antibiotic residues in soil, 32 soil samples were collected from a typical greenhouse vegetable production base...”{cite}`ZHAO2023`


2.	Annotating a concept with an inappropriate term.
    1.	Annotating a term which is too broad.

    2.	Annotating a term which is too specific.

    3.	Annotating a term which is in the wrong hierarchical context.
        * Annotating **nutrient transport** (BTs **nutrition physiology** and **physiological transport**) in “...This study makes a first attempt to quantify the nutrient transport linkages between the mainstream part of the Mekong River and Tonle Sap Lake, and to estimate the nutrient fluxes in the lower reach of the Mekong River at Kratie and Chroy Changva...”{cite}`SOK2022`
        
        * Annotating **biosynthesis** (BT **metabolism**) in "...in this study we report ...the synthesis of copper nanoparticles from seed extract of Vitis vinifera. The synthesis of copper nanoparticles from plant extracts showed promising results against biological and cytotoxic applications..."{cite}`plantbio`

    4.	Annotating a term which is inconsistent with scope notes or definitions.
        * Annotating **postpartum period** (Scope Note: Use for humans; For animals USE **postpartum interval**) in “...The results...demonstrate that during the postpartum period, lactating mares have some similarities in follicular and hormonal profiles around emergence and deviation when compared with non-postpartum cycling mares...”{cite}`PASTORELLO2022`


3.	Annotating a concept that should be ignored (e.g., information provided as background information or reference standards).

    1.	Insufficient information on concept to warrant retrieval effort.
        *	Annotating **forests** in “...Inspired by the natural geotexture of forests, a novel Ni/Co-based layered double hydroxide (Ni/Co-LDH) derived from the metal-organic framework grown on ZnO nanotubes...”{cite}`D2TA02399G`
        
        *	Annotating **United States Environmental Protection Agency** in “Surface sediments along the Southern Terengganu coast...were analyzed for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The concentrations of 16 USEPA priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (ΣPAH₁₆) ranged...”{cite}`pang`

    2.	Work not conducted as part of the research described in the full-text article.
        *	Annotating **oils** in “...Three marine ecological examples using ANOSIM to analyse an ordered factor in one‐way designs are provided. These are: (1) changes in macrofaunal composition with increasing distance from an oil rig; (2) differences in phytal meiofaunal community composition..."{cite}`Somerfield`
       
        *	Annotating **metallurgy** in 


4.	Annotating the same concept at more than one hierarchical level.


5.	Using the same word(s) to annotate two different concepts.


6.	Failing to annotate all significant components /facets of a concept.


7.	Failing to annotate significant negative results.
    1.	“...ultrasound measurements of abdominal muscle thickness were independently, negatively associated with PMA at full oral feedings...”{cite}`Nagel`

8.	Failing to annotate with concepts which are treated equally in the document.


9.	Annotating implications or speculations.
    
    1. “...The miR-211-3p could promote HSCC progression and upregulate CSF2/CCL20/TNF signaling to promote IC insensitivity in HSCC, which may provide new ideas for HSCC therapy.”{cite}`Lingwa`
 

10.	Annotating routine techniques, methods or procedures.


11.	Failing to annotate significant geographic concept.

    1. Not annotating **Pacific Ocean** in “Impacts of the East Asian winter monsoon on winter precipitation variability over East Asia-western North Pacific”{cite}`Zhenzhen`

    2. Not annotating **Central America** in “Velocity and Anisotropic Structure of the Uppermost Mantle Beneath Central America and Northwestern South America From Pn Tomography”{cite}`Zhao` 


12.	Assigning geographic term which is overly or insufficiently specific.
    
    1. Annotating **Brazil** instead of **South America** in “An Introduction to the Issue of Consumer Law in South America”{cite}`consumerlaw` (“This Special Issue...goes back to a conference...in Porto Alegre Brazil, the first of the Center of European and German Studies...”)

    2. Annotating **Canada** instead of **Alberta** in “Spatial regression modelling of particulate pollution in Calgary, Canada”{cite}`spatialB`


13.	Assigning geographic term for laboratory/greenhouse research, unless used in conjunction with field studies.

    1. Omit – annotating **Botswana** for “...The soil samples were collected from the greenhouse pot experiment that was carried out from August 2019 to October 2020 at the Botswana University of Agriculture and Natural Resources...”{cite}`Masocha`
    
    2. Include – annotating **Western Australia** for “...From 2017 to 2020, experiments were conducted at Cunderdin, Dandaragan, Three Springs, Manjimup, and Merredin in WA (Western Australia)...The experiments evaluated four sowing times, two sowing depths in the field sites, six sowing depths in a glasshouse experiment, three sowing rates, and three row spacings...”{cite}`agronomy22`


14.	Assigning an invalid annotation as a valid term. In computer-based indexing system, the NALT concept must be selected from a dropdown menu. If it is not properly selected, the annotated term may display with a plus sign indicating it does not match a NALT term (even if it does). This may show up as a duplicate term in the corresponding Golden Set if others annotated the term properly.[^1]


15.	Failing to define an important acronym or abbreviation with its corresponding NALT preferred term. 
    1. Not annotating **quantitative trait loci** in “Genetic diversity and QTL-marker association analysis of rice germplasm for grain number per panicle and its contributing traits”{cite}`geneticdiv`

[^1]: This is the case with Cogito Studio Express (CSE) but may be different with other computer-based indexing systems.

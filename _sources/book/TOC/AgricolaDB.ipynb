    "# The Agricola Database\n",
    "\n",
    "AGRICOLA (AGRICultural OnLine Access) is a bibliographic database of over 5 million citations to the agricultural literature, created by the National Agricultural Library (NAL) and its cooperators.  Previous versions of the indexing guidelines contain the history of Agricola, NAL Thesaurus (NALT) and past indexing practices â€“ see the bibliography for those.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of indexing articles for Agricola is to capture information related to agriculture and USDA topic areas (see https://www.usda.gov/topics for more information). \n",
    "\n",
    "Articles included in Agricola have been published in peer-reviewed journals and ideally are authored by individuals from one of the following categories:\n",
    "* [USDA and its agencies, centers and research programs](https://www.usda.gov/our-agency/agencies)\n",
    "* Other related government and non-government departments, agencies and organizations (e.g., Food & Drug Administration (FDA), US Agency for International Development (US AID), state and local agricultural agencies, Center for Produce Safety and National Dairy Council)\n",
    "* International, foreign and non-governmental organizations (e.g., UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), European Food Safety Authority, Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs and World Organization for Animal Health)\n",
    "* Universities and research institutions \n",

    "## Basic Indexing Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "1.)\tDetermine what you are indexing (*“indexing”* or *“annotating”*) based on the title, journal name and abstract (*“article”*). \n",
    "\n",
    "2.)\tThe NAL thesaurus (*“NALT”*) is the sole source for annotations, with concepts being added, modified, defined, redefined and deprecated, as needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "3.)\tAll articles must have at least three concepts to be processed. While there is no upper limit, that does not mean that every possible concept must be added. \n",
    "\n",
    "4.)\tLook for the “magic sentence” when the author(s) (*“author”*) starts talking about what they are doing and/or will be describing in the article. Do not index what has been done in the past, will be done in the future or is mentioned as background information or speculation. \n",
    "\n",
    "5.)\tBe aware that similar phrases or related concepts/terms (*“RTs”*) have different meanings and hierarchies. Review definitions, scope notes, Broader Concepts/Terms (*“BTs”*), Narrower Concepts/Terms (*“NTs”*), and Entry-Level (or hidden/alternate) Terms to ensure that you are selecting the appropriate concept(s). \n",
    "\n",
    "6.)\tDo not fixate on a term. Do not add concepts merely because they are in the title, journal name and/or article. Determine whether the concept is relevant to the article and is the best term to cover what the author is discussing or doing. \n",
    "\n",
    "7.)\tThe broadest, top-level concepts should not be used if narrower concepts are applicable and/or there are more than three concepts. \n",
    "\n",
    "8.)\tUse the narrowest concept possible but only if it describes the entire article and does not omit equal concept(s) not captured by a *NALT* concept. \n",
    "\n",
    "9.)\tReview annotated concepts to determine if all are necessary or better ones come to mind. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Agricola Database\n",
    "\n",
    "AGRICOLA (AGRICultural OnLine Access) is a bibliographic database of over 5 million citations to the agricultural literature, created by the National Agricultural Library (NAL) and its cooperators.  Previous versions of the indexing guidelines contain the history of Agricola, NAL Thesaurus (NALT) and past indexing practices – see the bibliography for those.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of indexing articles for Agricola is to capture information related to agriculture and USDA topic areas (see https://www.usda.gov/topics for more information). \n",
    "\n",
    "Articles included in Agricola have been published in peer-reviewed journals and ideally are authored by individuals from one of the following categories:\n",
    "* [USDA and its agencies, centers and research programs](https://www.usda.gov/our-agency/agencies)\n",
    "* Other related government and non-government departments, agencies and organizations (e.g., Food & Drug Administration (FDA), US Agency for International Development (US AID), state and local agricultural agencies, Center for Produce Safety and National Dairy Council)\n",
    "* International, foreign and non-governmental organizations (e.g., UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), European Food Safety Authority, Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs and World Organization for Animal Health)\n",
    "* Universities and research institutions \n",
    "\n",
    "> See [Supplement A](SupplementA) for types of articles not typically indexed for Agricola. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## MARC Format\n",
    "\n",
    "MARC (MAchine-Readable Cataloging) is used to define three fields that appear in Agricola records; a fourth field for subject category codes is no longer used. While MARC fields may appear on some external platforms, they are largely transparent in the indexing process. NAL systems that manage both human-indexed and machine-indexed articles automatically assign the appropriate field for each term.    \n",
    "\n",
    "> __650__  NALT terms \n",
    "\n",
    "> __651__  Geographical terms \n",
    "\n",
    "> __653__ Identifiers (this field is limited to machine-indexed articles and is automatically populated by the system, as needed)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The NAL Thesaurus (NALT)\n",
    "\n",
    "The [***NALT***](https://agclass.nal.usda.gov/) is the controlled vocabulary and sole source of terms/concepts for indexing articles. These terms can be organisms (taxonomic or common names), products, phenomena, particular objectives or perspectives, facilities, activities, operations, equipment, processes, techniques, geographic names, environmental conditions and the elements that affects any of these. \n",
    " \n",
    " ```{margin} *NALT Core* \n",
    " (subscheme with 13,791 frequently-used concepts including 4,396 agriculturally important organisms (taxa), and structural updates)\n",
    "```\n",
    " ```{margin} *NALT Full*\n",
    "(*NALT Core* plus 48,000+ additional agricultural related organisms and several thousand less-frequently used concepts for a total of 76,933 concepts)\n",
    "```\n",
    "There are two options, ***NALT Core*** and ***NALT Full***.\n",
    "\n",
    "When considering proposal of a new term, always ask:\n",
    "* Will this term be used often enough to justify its addition to NALT?\n",
    "* Does this term represent a concept which can be consistently and reliability differentiated from any other concept?\n",
    "\n",
    "### _Proposing a new term:_\n",
    "*\tConsult relevant, authoritative resources (e.g., AGROVOC, CAB thesaurus) first when proposing a new term. Consider other specialized resources in (e.g., MESH, AlgaeBase), dictionaries, handbooks, monographs, textbooks and number of postings of the proposed concept in relevant databases. Do not use all-purpose dictionaries. See [Supplement B](SupplementB) for some additional resources."

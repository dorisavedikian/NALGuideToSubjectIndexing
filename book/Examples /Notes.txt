# Create virtual environment (index), activate index and install cookiecutter and jupyter-book 
python3 -m venv index
source index/bin/activate
index/bin/pip install -U cookiecutter jupyter-book

# Type the following in the command line and answer the questions
cookiecutter gh:giswqs/cookiecutter-jupyter-book 

# cd into the repo created in the questions & Install requirements.txt
cd NALGuideToSubjectIndexing
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create a GitHub repo to host the book

Notes: 
- I had to comment out _build/ and _build/html in .gitignore.txt in order for the 
file to be added to the repo. 
- Updated python version to 3.10.10 in deploy.yml
- Got the following error: "Error: The process '/usr/bin/git' failed with exit code 128" 
and found a solution by @realnikolaj here : https://github.com/actions/checkout/issues/417

# Make edits to the book by adding more content, updating the table of contents, etc. in:
_toc.yml 
_config.yml
See https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html for more info on customizing the book.

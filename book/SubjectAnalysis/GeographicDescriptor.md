## Geographic Descriptors
Include geographical terms under these circumstances:
*	there is a specific geographic location in the title
*	the article contains maps of specific geographic area(s)
*	a specific area has been surveyed
*	field research has been or is being done
*	flora or fauna of a region has been or is being studied
*	new taxa or other taxonomic information (e.g., ecological invasion, geographical distribution) are described
*	specific organizations or institutions are the primary topic {cite}`Naoto` 

Consider including geographical topics for articles with these subjects:
*	ecology, including pollution
*	economics
*	education/training
*	epidemiology
*	history/paleontology/archaeology
*	human ecology
*	land and/or water resources
*	legislation, jurisprudence or politics
*	meteorology/climatology
*	sociology

Geographical terms should be added for living subjects studied in the natural environment or specimens collected in one country and studied or held in another. 
  *	A study about food habits of Salvadorans living in Manhattan would be assigned __New York__ and __Hispanics__[^1] as descriptors.  
  *	An article about insects collected in Ghana but studied at an ARS laboratory in Maryland would be assigned __Ghana__ (but not __Maryland__).
  *	An article about captive lions in an American zoo would not be assigned a geographic term. The zoo’s location may be included if it is relevant to the entire article. 

Some countries, states and regions have narrower or related concepts. It may be necessary to research which term is the correct one(s) to annotate. 
 *	“In 2019, leaves with anthracnose symptoms were observed on pitcher plants (Sarracenia purpurea subsp. purpurea f. heterophylla) in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan...”{cite}`anthracnose` __Okinawa__ is an entry-level term for __Ryukyu Archipelago__, an NT of __Japan__. 
 *	“...we develop a novel semi‐quantitative metabarcoding approach that combines specimen counts and size‐sorting to characterize arthropod community‐level diversity patterns along elevational transects on two different volcanoes of the island of Hawai‘i...”{cite}`molecular`. The study is being done specifically on __Hawaii (island)__, not across multiple islands of __Hawaii__.
 *	"Losses of C and N from the forest floor and top 20-cm of soil were estimated following separate severe wildfires at two Long-Term Soil Productivity sites in the Sierra Nevada of California, USA. Experimental treatments applied 20 years prior to the wildfires..."{cite}`Zhang_2023`v Since they are related (not BT-NT), both __California__ and __Sierra Nevada (California)__ can be annotated. See discussion below on __Named Geographical Regions.__

Do not assume that a cardinal direction is part of an official state, territory or country name and not just indicating a part of the state, territory or country. If the study area is not clear in the abstract, check the full text for any maps or descriptions. 
 *	“...we present and examine a relatively dense network of wood property chronologies...from several species in __Tasmania__, southern Australia...”{cite}`ALLEN2022`
 *	"... Our study area consisted of 26 sites in western Virginia within the Blue Ridge, Ridge and Valley, and Appalachian Plateau physiographic provinces, extending from Highland County in the north to Lee County in the southwest...”{cite}`Eagle` Maps in the full text articles confirm the study area is in the southwestern corner of __Virginia__. 
 *	"...The South African soil data, together with the SOTER data of Angola, Botswana, eSwatini (previously Swaziland), Namibia, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe formed the SOTERSAF database..."{cite}`BODENSTEIN2022` A map showing the study area confirms it covers Angola, Botswana, eSwatini, Namibia, Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe so __Southern Africa__ would be annotated. 

If they are specifically mentioned in the article, __Named Geographical Regions__ may be annotated alongside country/state names, particularly those comprising a large area covering several countries, states or bodies of water; denoting a particular area of a country or continent; and/or representing an environment different (e.g., climatically, geomorphologically, culturally) from other parts of that country or state. 
 *	__Amazonia__
 *	__El Gran Chaco__
 *	__Himalayan region__
 *  __Maghreb__
 *	__Pacific Rim__

Confirm the correct location of all geographic names, especially those not in NALT, since some names are used in more than one country or location.
 *	Iran Mountains – mountain range on __Borneo__ 
 *	Mérida – city in both __Spain__ and __Mexico__
 *	Plymouth – city and/or county in several US states (e.g., __Massachusetts, Michigan__ and __Connecticut__), __England__ and __Montserrat__
 *	Washington – __Washington (state), Washington DC__ (preferred term __District of Columbia__), city and/or county in several US States (e.g., __Georgia, Illinois__ and __Pennsylvania__), 

Locations not included in NALT may not be easily found through standard USDA resources. It may be necessary to research where the place is and what it represents. 
 *	South China Karst (UNESCO World Heritage Site in __China__)[^2]
 *	Transnistria (unrecognized breakaway state internationally considered part of __Moldova__)[^3]

Do not use historical geographic locations for current publications. 
 *	__Czechoslovakia__ (existed 1918-1992) -> use __Czech Republic__ and/or __Slovakia__
 *	__Yugoslavia__ (existed 1918-1992) -> use __Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Slovenia, Republic__ of __North Macedonia__ and/or __Serbia__ and __Montenegro__. NOTE: __Kosovo__ is a breakaway state of Serbia (split off in 2008) that is recognized by US and some other counties but has only __Europe__ as its BT.

Geographic place names may include landforms as part of the name. Consult NALT for the appropriate term to annotate. Do not include the landform as a separate term, unless it is relevant to the entire article’s subject. Note whether the landform starts with an upper or lower case letter and is a singular or plural form.
 *	entry-level term __Blue Mountains__ – preferred term __Blue Mountain Region__ (Oregon) (not to be confused with the Blue Mountains in __Pennsylvania__ and __Australia__)
 *	entry-level term __Piedmont (Italy)__ – preferred term __Italy__ (not the landform __piedmont__)
 *	entry-level term __Tibetan Plateau__ – preferred term __China__ 

For articles discussing bodies of water, do not automatically add a descriptive place name(s) (e.g., state, country) in addition to the named body of water. Is the study area is in the water, on land next to the body of water or both? Determine if the place name is appropriate for the entire article or is merely describing where the body of water is. 
 *	__California – Gulf of California__ (in __Mexico__)
 *	__Chad – Lake Chad__ (in __Cameroon, Chad, Niger__ and __Nigeria__)
 *	__Ohio – Ohio River__ (runs through __Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois__ and __Kentucky__)

It is not necessary to include the name of the landform if it is part of an already-annotated preferred term, is not a significant concept in the article or would not provide any additional information. 
 *	__Black Hills National Forest__
 *	__Colorado Desert__
 *	__Great Salt Lake__
 *	__Mississippi River__

Do not include geographic terms that appear in plant or animal names unless the geographic term also refers to where the plant or animal is. 
 *	“...We made our observation during daily landbird migration banding operations at a station within the Bon Secour National Wildlife Refuge on the Fort Morgan Peninsula of Alabama, USA...”{cite}`Theodore`
 *	“Zeins, the major storage proteins in corn (Zea mays L.) endosperms, consist of a large number of related polypeptides...This study examines the variability of zeins in ‘Reid Yellow Dent’, ‘Lancaster Sure Crop’, and eight Illinois chemical strains...”{cite}`cropscience`
 *	“...we investigate the influence of spatial structuring and social interactions on the gut microbiome composition of Welsh mountain ponies...the gut microbiome of semi-feral ponies from Snowdonia National Park is influenced by spatial structuring, social interactions, and kin relationships..."{cite}`article18` 

### Assignment of geographical descriptors - Summary
1. Do not assign geographical descriptors based solely on those terms in the common or taxonomic names of strains of bacteria and other organisms. (e.g., Newcastle disease, Egypt bee virus).
2. The geographical origin of a strain or line can be used even if the work is done in vitro (e.g., supporting epidemiological studies of disease outbreaks). 
3. For articles in which subjects (animals, plants, humans) migrate/invade or are imported/introduced from one country/area and studied in another, apply a geographical descriptor for the country where the subjects were studied and indicate their geographical origin, if appropriate. This applies only to living subjects studied in a natural environment (e.g., not laboratory/captive animals or museum specimens).
4. Do not assign geographical terms based solely on author affiliation or journal name.
5. Do not add geographical descriptors for laboratory or greenhouse studies, unless done as comparison to field studies. 
6. There is no limit to the number of geographical descriptors that may be used. However, in most cases where more than five or six are applicable, it may make more sense to use a broader geographical term that subsumes the others. 
7. Do not use historical geographic locations for current research or discussion. 
8. If more than four continents (e.g., Asia, Europe, Africa, South America, North America) are mentioned but no narrower concepts are discussed, omit them.
9. Confirm the location of place names not in the *NALT*.

[^1]: Or Latinos (people who are or descended from immigrants from Latin America (Caribbeans islands, Central and South America but not USA and Canada), including non-Hispanics, e.g., Haitians, Brazilians, Guyanese) NOTE – definition from ERIC thesaurus. Hispanic refers to people who speak Spanish or are descended from Spanish-speaking populations (includes Spain) and is generally self-reported. Definition has changed multiple times since 1970’s, primarily related to Census questionnaire.

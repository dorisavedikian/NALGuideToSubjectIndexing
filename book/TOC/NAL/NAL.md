# The NAL Thesaurus (NALT)

The [***NALT***](https://agclass.nal.usda.gov/) is the controlled vocabulary and sole source of terms/concepts for indexing articles. These terms can be organisms (taxonomic or common names), products, phenomena, particular objectives or perspectives, facilities, activities, operations, equipment, processes, techniques, geographic names, environmental conditions and the elements that affects any of these. 

There are two options, ***NALT Core***[^1] and ***NALT Full***[^2].

When considering proposal of a new term, always ask:
* Will this term be used often enough to justify its addition to NALT?
* Does this term represent a concept which can be consistently and reliability differentiated from any other concept?

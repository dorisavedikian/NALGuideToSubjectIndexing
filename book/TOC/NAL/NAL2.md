__Proposing a new term:__

*	Consult relevant, authoritative resources (e.g., AGROVOC, CAB thesaurus) first when proposing a new term. Consider other specialized resources in (e.g., MESH, AlgaeBase), dictionaries, handbooks, monographs, textbooks and number of postings of the proposed concept in relevant databases. Do not use all-purpose dictionaries. See [Supplement B](SupplementB) for some additional resources.

*	Changes include adding or deprecating (removing from preferred/accepted terminology) concepts, modifying hierarchies and adding/amending definitions or scope notes. Justification and additional comments should be neutral and business-like. Recommend term during Golden Sets review (see [Work-Flow](Workflow) )

*	If the proposed term is already included in another thesaurus, suggest the term as it appears in that thesaurus to maintain consistency. If the term is in several thesauri in different forms (e.g., hyphenation, capitalization), recommend the one that follows NALT naming convention (see below) with other forms included as entry-level terms.

*	Follow conventions of capitalization[^1] used in NALT, i.e., capitalize formal names, geographical terms and acronyms, use lower case[^2] for non-specific places or things, etc.

*	Consider spelling variants, synonyms, and quasi-synonyms before proposing a new term.
    *	__Example:__ For “Nutrient solution concentration and collection time in phytomass production, content, yield and chemical composition of essential oil of rosemary”{cite}`JoPN_2018`, NALT does not have a term to cover specifically “essential oil of rosemary”.  
        * Consider proposing **rosemary oil** (CABI thesaurus term) as a preferred term, with **essential oil of rosemary, rosemary essential oil and Rosmarinus officinalis essential oil** (among others) as potential entry-level terms.
    *	__Example:__ For “Effects of Coffee and Its Components on the Gastrointestinal Tract and the Brain–Gut Axis”, {cite}`Nutrients_20` *NALT* has __coffee (beverage)__ and __gastrointestinal system__ but not “brain-gut axis” or another term that covers that concept. 
        * Propose __brain-gut axis__ (existing MESH term, “interactive network between the gastrointestinal tract (gut) and the brain principally mediated through the enteric nervous system ...”) as the preferred term __with brain and gut axis, brain-gut-microbiome axis, gut and brain axis, gut-brain axis__ and other variations as entry-level terms.

*	Terms should always be nouns, noun phrases (phrase formed by a noun and all its modifiers and determiners), or gerunds (a word that is derived from a verb but functions as a noun).
    *	nouns – __cattle, farms, hematophagy, loci__
    *	noun phrases – __antibrowning agents, artificial flavorings, old animals, red light__
    *	gerunds – __allografting, farrowing, milking, plowing__

*	Exclude prepositions in noun phrases unless doing so violates accepted English usage or official naming convention, may be misleading in its connotation or could have an ambiguous meaning, or the proposal is already a standard, accepted term. 
    *	entry-level term __resistance to lodging__ -> preferred term __lodging resistance__
    *	entry-level term __alternatives to animal testing__ -> preferred term __animal use alternatives__ 
    *	preferred terms __appropriate level of protection, brain as food, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching__ and __Bay of Bengal__

*	Adjectives are used only with nouns as part of noun phrases (see above), not as independent terms.

*	Use the singular form for processes, properties, attributes and unique things. Use plural for classes of objects, e.g., common names for organisms, groups of things.
    *	singular – __brain, jasmone, food supply chain, subsurface drainage, yellow fever__
    *	plural – __animal organs, oxylipins, supply chain disruptions, drainage systems, Flavivirus infections__

*	Use natural word order. If appropriate, propose the inverted form as an entry-level term.
    *	__agricultural development__, not __developing agriculture__ or __development of agriculture__
    *	__climate change__, not __changing climate__ 
    *	__food processing__, not __processing food__ or __processing of food__

*	Avoid punctuation, including hyphens[^3], if possible. Some exceptions include (but are not exclusively) taxonomic names, chemical compounds, scientific terms and accepted terms from other thesauri. 

*	Use scientific terminology rather than lay/colloquial terminology. 
    *	__neoplasms__, not cancer
    *	__renal calculi__, not kidney stones
    *	__tibia__, not shinbone

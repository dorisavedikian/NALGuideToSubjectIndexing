# Creating hierarchy and relationships:
*	Supply at least one BT (preferably an existing NALT term) for each proposed term. The relationship between a proposed term and its BT should be generic (i.e., the BT is a class of concepts of which the proposed term is a member or is a part/whole relationship). If the proposed term is already in another thesaurus, use that hierarchy if the same or similar terms are already in NALT.
    *	proposed term __rosemary oil__ – BT __essential oils__ (or other appropriate NALT term)
    *	proposed term __brain-gut axis__ – BT __neurophysiology__ (or other appropriate NALT term)

*	Providing NTs and RTs is optional but these should be valid or proposed NALT terms. If the latter, submit the proposals concurrently and indicate this in the submission.

*	A term is assumed to include any of its common definitions. Indicate if certain definitions are to be excluded from the scope of the term or if an uncommon definition will be used. 
    *	__mineralization__ (BT __chemical reactions__, breakdown of organic compounds to their inorganic (i.e., mineral) forms) versus __bone mineralization__ (BT __bone formation__)
    *	__phytotoxins__ (any toxins or poisons that are produced by a plant) versus __phytotoxicity__ (any substance that is toxic or poisonous to a plant). Some dictionaries and thesauri reverse the definitions or treat the two terms as synonyms of each other. 

*	If the proposed term is the same or similar to a common word or name, add a qualifier to distinguish it from the common word. If uncertain, search the Internet for possible conflicts. 
    *	__Alabama (Lepidoptera)__ versus the state of __Alabama__ 
    *	__Alexa (Faboideae)__ versus the personal name “Alexa” or Amazon’s virtual assistant technology 
    *	__Damascus (goat breed)__ versus the capital of __Syria__
    *	__does (females)__ versus third person present form of the verb “do”
    *	__spat (shellfish)__ versus past participle of the verb “spit” 

*	If a term has different meanings in different hierarchies, create separate terms with clarifying words, scope notes and/or definitions. 
    *	__fuels__ (BT __energy resources__) versus __fuels (fire ecology)__ (BT __fire ecology__)
    *	__fertilization (soils)__ (preferred term __fertilizer application__) versus __fertilization (reproduction)__
    *	__ponding (natural)__ (BT __hydrology__) versus __ponding (water management)__ (BT __water management__)

*	Indicate the source of the term, definition, scope notes and/or hierarchy for follow-up. If possible, provide documentation (e.g., websites, governing authority) supporting the change. 

```{note}
Requests will be reviewed by the indexing team for validity and necessity during the Golden Sets review. Priority will be given to terms related to agriculture and/or USDA topic areas. Generally, annotations using stop words, consisting of full sentences, or highlighting single words to represent phrases will not be added as preferred or entry-level terms.

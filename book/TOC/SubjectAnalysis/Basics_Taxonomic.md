# Basics for Using Taxonomic Names

(see [Supplement C](SuppC) for a summary of this section)

```{contents}

```

Check taxonomy names carefully. Research anything that is not clear and/or listed in NALT; search multiple relevant databases and websites, if needed (see [Supplement B](SupplementB)). 

For new species (or genus, family, etc.), ensure that taxonomic name does not already exist as an entry-level term. 

Ensure any taxonomic names are valid and have not been superseded. If a name has changed, annotate the existing _NALT_ concept (e.g., species, genus) and submit the new name and any supporting documentation; see [NAL Thesaurus](NAL). 
*	The article “Response of mycorrhizal symbiosis to phosphorus and its application for sustainable crop production and remediation of environment”{cite}`Keitaro` refers to the fungus _Rhizophagus clarus. R. clarus_ is not listed in _NALT_ but several taxonomic databases (e.g., GBIF, MycoBank) indicate that the NALT term _Glomus clarum_ is a basionym for _R. clarus._ 

For varieties of the same species, ensure that you are selecting the correct term.
*	For “Terpenoids from _Nardostachys jatamansi_ and their cytotoxic activity against human pancreatic cancer cell lines”{cite}`MA2022`, _NALT_ contains two different terms for _N. jatamansi: N. jatamansi (Jones ex Roxb.) DC._ (preferred label __Valeriana jatamansi__) AND _N. jatamansi auct._ (preferred label __Nardostachys grandiflora__). The first sentence of the article indicates which one is being described, _“Nardostachys jatamansi DC._ (Valerianaceae) (Chauhan et al., 2008) is an endangered and perennial distributed in the alpine region ...”

Taxonomic names may be changed on some platforms but not all. Annotate the existing NALT concept and submit the new name and supporting documentation.
* For “Physicochemical properties and volatile profile of mung bean flour fermented by _Lacticaseibacillus casei_ and _Lactococcus lactis_”{cite}`GIANGRIECO2022`, __L. lactis__ is in NALT but _L. casei_ is not. Per Wikipedia, _“Lacticaseibacillus casei_ is an organism that belongs to the largest genus in the family _Lactobacillaceae_, a lactic acid bacteria (LAB), that was previously classified as Lactobacillus casei ...”. Per https://www.optibacprobiotics.com, this change was made in 2020 so it may not be recognized on all platforms yet. 

Do not mix up the same or similar words in different levels and hierarchies. 
*	__Pachystigma (genus)__ vs. __Cuscuta L. subgenus Pachystigma__
*	__Oocystis__ vs. __oocysts__
*	__Tilapia (*Cichlidae*)__ vs __tilapia (common name)__
*	Genus name used as a common name to describe another genus/species: “Effect of dietary Spirulina (_Arthrospira platensis_) on the intestinal function of post-weaned piglet: An approach combining proteomics, metabolomics and histological studies”{cite}`MARTINS2022`. In NALT, A. __platensis__ includes __Spirulina jenneri var. platensis__ and __S. platensis__ as entry-level terms. 


## General Considerations

For scientific names (“taxonomic name”), use the highest level of specificity available in _NALT_. This might be order, family, genus, or species.  Standards and guidance are provided below by general organism type.

In cases where the use of a taxonomic name is required but is not available in the article, search AGRICOLA or other resources (see Supplement B).  Common or group names (“common name”) can be highly variable and often very localized so the taxonomic name may not be obvious. If the common name is not in NALT, check the full-text article to see if the author provides the taxonomy and/or alternate common names. If the species name is not in NALT, use the genus. If the genus is not available, use the family name and so on. If an indexer cannot trace the taxonomic name at any level in the taxonomic hierarchy with some degree of certainty and within a reasonable period of time (i.e., 5-10 minutes), it may be necessary to assign a role or context term (“role/context”) to convey the intended topic.  

Not all full taxonomic names (i.e., genus and species) have a common name associated with them in NALT and vice versa. If there is ambiguity about what the organism is (e.g., common beans), confirm the taxonomic or common name in the full article. Ensure you are annotating the correct common or taxonomic name based on the organism being described (e.g., __rats__ versus __mole rats__ versus __kangaroo rats__ [preferred term __*Dipodomys*__]).

If a role/context is an RT of the organism(s) or product(s), it may be assigned if it is relevant to the entire article and not just mentioned as an aside. See the examples for each organism listed below.

Select the appropriate level of specificity for the common name or role/context. If uncertain, check the taxonomic name to determine the appropriate term(s). See example abstract below.

````{margin} Best Practice
Should Capsicum AND/OR peppers, Cucumis sativus AND/OR cucumbers, Solanum lycopersicum AND/OR tomatoes, and Solanum melongena AND/OR eggplants be assigned?
```{note}
Taxonomic names for plants are not mentioned in the full-text article but they do use several cultivars. The question is what is the focus? It seems that the study was trying to determine whether predatory mites were more successful in controlling the spidermites on certain plants.

|Title: The effect of host plant on the biological control efficacy of the predatory mite, Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot against two-spotted spidermites, Tetranychus vurticae koch on field-grown vegetables.|
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|__Abstract__: Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae) is one of the key pests causing economic losses in vegetable fields. Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot (Acari: Phytoseiidae) is used effectively in the biological control of this mite on many vegetable crops. The present study determined how different crops such as <mark>pepper, eggplant, cucumber</mark> and <mark>tomato</mark> affected the biological control of T. urticae when using P. persimilis in the field-grown vegetables in the Çanakkale of northwestern part of Turkey in 2016 and 2017. Predatory and prey mites were released at a ratio of 1:10 predator:prey on host plants and their numbers on leaves were counted weekly for a period of 8 weeks. The highest number of T. urticae and P. persimilis were counted on <mark>cucumber</mark> with 108.70 ± 8.14 and 81.00 ± 6.00 mites per leaf in 2016, and with 113.30 ± 10.95 and 24.00 ± 4.58 mites per leaf in 2017, respectively. Also, there was a significant difference for both the populations of T. urticae and P. persimilis on the crops on all weeks in both years. It was revealed that P. persimilis markedly suppressed T. urticae on <mark>eggplant</mark> and <mark>tomato</mark> compared to <mark>pepper</mark>  and <mark>cucumber</mark> in both years. It is clear that the host crops is a key factor on the success of P. persimilis on the biological control of T. urticae on field-grown vegetables. Consequently, it is thought that these results should be taken into account in the biological control strategies of mite pests by using the predatory mites on field-grown vegetables. {cite}`hostplant`|

Articles less than one page on insect or plant taxonomy and nomenclature as well as new cultivar and germplasm registrations are indexed.

### Q)	Plants
1. Index the taxonomic name for the plant specified in the article. If the author uses a different taxonomic name other than what is listed in NALT, but which is also a valid preferred term for the plant, use that term. 
    1.	Example: for __tomatoes__, the preferred NALT term is __*Solanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum*__ but many authors use Solanum lycopersicum. Per Germplasm Resource Information Network (GRIN), both are acceptable but other taxonomic databases consider only _S. lycopersicum_ valid and _S. lycopersicum var. lycopersicum_ as invalid.
2. Add the common name, if available. Check the RT relationship in _NALT_ for the commodity or product name. See [Supplement C](SuppC) for guidance on when to include both the taxonomic and common names and when to annotate only one.
    1.	For "Transcriptome Response of Maize (Zea Mays L.) Seedlings to Heat Stress,"{cite}`Zhong`, __corn__ and __*Zea mays*__ should be annotated.

## 4.1.1.e - Use of terms for diseases and experimental animal models
A primary consideration in this section are indexing practices that will recognize the relationship(s) between the host organism, the disease organism and the resulting disease.  Unless noted, in the circumstances below, the specificity of terms will be assigned as described under Section 4.1.1.b – Specificity.

## Assignment of terms - Summary
*	Check taxonomic and common names carefully to ensure you are annotating the correct ones that correspond with the organism described in the article. 
*	Assign terms for organisms and products based on their role/context if that is the focus of the research or discussion, not just mentioned in passing.
* Assign terms in a manner that is consistent with their hierarchies, RTs, definitions and scope notes.
* If the articles equally covers more than three species (or genus, etc.) under one genus (or family, etc.), use the genus (or family, etc.) name. 
* Assign terms for diseases (human, animal and plant) and experimental animal models according to the sections on <u>Use of terms for diseases</u> and <u>Use of terms for experimental animal models</u>.

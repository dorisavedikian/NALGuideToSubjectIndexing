Key to this is the use of search engines for the interpretation of mass spectra acquired after HLA peptide purification and LC-MS. In this study we present a comparison of three commonly used search engines across several immunopeptidomic datasets. We found that choice of search engine influences not only sensitivity but remarkably the repertoire of peptide sequences identified. Using NetMHC we validate our results showing that additional peptides identified are highly likely to be bound to a HLA protein. Based on this we investigate how search engine bias affects the outcome of an immunopeptidomic analyses given a background of different HLA alleles. We look in detail at this effect profiling several tumour samples with diverse HLA types.}

Food concepts can be represented by thousands of different terms but subject scope of a particular term is sometimes vague. There exist important differences among thesauri regarding same or similar concept. A term that represents narrower or broader concept in one thesaurus can in another stand for a related concept or be non-existent. Sometimes there is no clear implication of differences between scientific (Latin) and common (English) names. Too many related terms can confuse end-users. Thesauri were initially employed mostly by information professionals but can now be used directly by users who may be unaware of differences. Thesauri are assuming new roles in classification of information as metadata. Further development towards ontologies must pay constant attention to taxonomic problems of representation of knowledge.",

The present paper reviews the existing international methods of identifying foods in the computerized databases: Codex Alimentarius, CIAA Food Categorization systems, Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, Procome, Eurocode-2, INFIC, LanguaL, INFOODS, IIS, COST Action 99 Recommendations.

	abstract = {In recent years, several evolutions have drastically transformed the way researchers as well as scientific and technical information (STI) services interact with scientific literature. The amount and pace of publications are skyrocketing, whether in journals and conferences or through pre-publication repositories (e.g., arxiv.org), such that it is increasingly difficult to keep up, find and make sense of relevant articles. Furthermore, the specialization of research communities makes it difficult to discover cross-disciplinary knowledge, which is essential to meet the growing demand of funding agencies for interdisciplinary projects. Scientific open archives are central in this landscape, however the keyword-based search services that they usually provide fail to grasp the semantic relationships between articles. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new tools that allow users to find their way in this mass of knowledge.In this talk, we wish to present the methods, tools and services implemented in the ISSA*2 project to address these needs, and discuss how they could fit and be deployed in the biodiversity area. Guided by the open science goals and embracing the FAIR*1 principles, the project aims to:provide a generic, transferable and extensible pipeline for the analysis and processing of the articles of an open scientific archive;turn the processing results into a semantic index stored and published as a public RDF knowledge graph;develop innovative search and visualization services that leverage this semantic index to allow researchers, decision makers or STI professionals to explore thematic association rules, networks of co-publications, articles with co-occurring topics, etc. The semantic index construction process involves several artificial intelligence techniques: natural language processing, knowledge engineering and Semantic Web. These techniques are used to process the publications’ metadata and text to automatically extract thematic descriptors and named entities. These descriptors and named entities are linked to knowledge bases such as Wikidata, DBpedia and GeoNames, or domain-specific terminological resources suited to the archive's domain. The semantic index linked with the third-party resources serves as a keystone to support the development of rich search and visualization tools aimed at researchers and/or STI professionals.We demonstrated the effectiveness of this solution in the use case of Agritrop, an institutional archive of 110,000+ resources among which are 12,000 open access articles, specialized in the fields of agronomy, biodiversity and sustainable development. In this context, the Agrovoc multilingual thesaurus was used as a domain-specific reference vocabulary. Fig. 1 illustrates how the concepts mentioned in the articles of the archive can be used to discover and visualize association rules. In this example, articles mentioning concepts COVID-19 and food security (a) frequently mention concept pandemics (b). Fig. 2 shows how other visualization techniques can help users search articles mentioning concept health or any of its sub-concepts (a and b), discover that it is often co-mentioned with climate change (c), and get the list of related publications (d) and their time distribution (e).Being designed as a generic, transferable solution, the pipeline and visualization tools delivered by ISSA could be easily adapted to open archives of biodiversity literature. Typically, terminological references such as Darwin Core Terms, Access to Biological Collection Data (ABCD), open Digital Specimens (openDS), Audubon Core Metadata Schema as well as various taxonomic registries, could be considered for the description of an article's metadata or the linking of thematic descriptors and named entities. From there, the proposed visualization techniques could easily be reconfigured to explore the articles from a biodiversity open archive to answer various competency questions, for instance: what are the articles that mention a taxon or any of its child taxa? What are the museums/institutions that are more frequently mentioned together with certain taxonomic groups? What are the research topics that frequently co-occur with climate change, and how do these topics evolve through the years? What public policies frequently occur in articles that mention endangered species? Furthermore, the pipeline could be extended by including existing third-party tools to carry out e.g., the extraction of relationships between entities or the reconciliation of authors' names.},

abstract = {Abstract The aim of the present research was to ascertain the importance of electronic bibliographic database selection and multiple database usage during the information retrieval phase of research in the food sciences. Six commonly recommended databases were compared with respect to overall journal coverage and journal overlap. Databases were also evaluated with respect to coverage of food science-based journals and the extent of article coverage therein. A case study approach, focused on bile acid/dietary fiber interactions, was used to illustrate the ramifications of database selection/usage when dealing with specific research topics. Databases differed with respect to the breadth of disciplines covered, the total number of journals indexed, the number of food science discipline-specific journals indexed, and the number of articles included per indexed journal. All of the databases contained citations that were unique to the given database. The data resulting from the case study provide an example of the extent to which relevant information may be missed if pertinent databases are not mined. In the present case, over half of the articles retrieved on the focus research topic were unique to a single database. The combined data from this study point to the importance of thoughtful database selection and multiple database usage when comprehensively assessing knowledge in the food sciences. Practical Application This paper provides insights into article database usage for food science-relevant information retrieval. Online information retrieval is an efficient way to assess current knowledge in any of the food science disciplines. Acquired knowledge in turn is the underpinning of effective problem solving; whether it be private sector- or academic/government-based research.},

abstract = {Relationships between terms and features are an essential component of thesauri, ontologies, and a range of controlled vocabularies. In this article, we describe ways to identify important concepts in documents using the relationships in a thesaurus or other vocabulary structures. We introduce a methodology for the analysis and modeling of the indexing process based on a weighted random walk algorithm. The primary goal of this research is the analysis of the contribution of thesaurus structure to the indexing process. The resulting models are evaluated in the context of automatic subject indexing using four collections of documents pre-indexed with 4 different thesauri (AGROVOC [UN Food and Agriculture Organization], high-energy physics taxonomy [HEP], National Agricultural Library Thesaurus [NALT], and medical subject headings [MeSH]). We also introduce a thesaurus-centric matching algorithm intended to improve the quality of candidate concepts. In all cases, the weighted random walk improves automatic indexing performance over matching alone with an increase in average precision (AP) of 9\% for HEP, 11\% for MeSH, 35\% for NALT, and 37\% for AGROVOC. The results of the analysis support our hypothesis that subject indexing is in part a browsing process, and that using the vocabulary and its structure in a thesaurus contributes to the indexing process. The amount that the vocabulary structure contributes was found to differ among the 4 thesauri, possibly due to the vocabulary used in the corresponding thesauri and the structural relationships between the terms. Each of the thesauri and the manual indexing associated with it is characterized using the methods developed here.},

abstract = {Abstract The impetus for this study is the limited amount of information on performance characteristics of food science–encompassing online bibliographic databases. Database usage is an important element in modern research because a comprehensive understanding of current knowledge is essential for effective, unbiased hypothesis formulation and testing. Six databases commonly recommended by academic libraries for information retrieval in the food sciences (Academic Search Premier [ASP], Agricultural Online Access [AGRICOLA], CAB Direct, Food Science and Technology Abstracts [FSTA], PubMed, and Web of Science [WoS]) were compared in a case study based on the research topic “in vitro bile acid binding properties of dietary lignin.” A complex string of search terms was used for citation retrieval, and predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria were used to determine the relevancy of retrieved articles. Searching WoS and CAB Direct returned the greatest number of relevant articles, followed closely by FSTA, PubMed, and AGRICOLA. FSTA and AGRICOLA returned the highest ratios of relevant-to-irrelevant articles, followed closely by CAB Direct. None of the databases, when used alone, recovered all of the relevant articles identified in the study; WoS indexed the highest percentage of relevant articles identified (WoS = 10; total = 19). WoS also had the highest number of relevant articles that were unique to any one database. The thoroughness of searching the complete group of databases was tested by comparison of retrieved citations with those found in relevant review articles, revealing the need for testing overall inclusivity. Practical Application Comprehensive online information retrieval is the most efficient means of accessing current knowledge. Awareness of current knowledge is essential for effective, unbiased decision making in private sector and academic/government-based research endeavors. Thus, online database usage is an essential element of modern food science research. This paper provides tangible examples of the performance characteristics of online bibliographic databases commonly recommended for information retrieval in the food sciences. The paper is written so as to aid the reader in making decisions with respect to database usage for the recovery of topic-relevant peer-reviewed articles germane to their area of research.},

  abstract={ This Special Issue has a long history. It goes back to a conference in July 2017 organized by Cláudia Lima Marques in Porto Alegre Brazil, the first of the Center of European and German Studies (CDEA–DAAD). Cláudia Lima Marques managed to bring together consumer lawyers from many South American States. From there it was a long way down to find support for a special issue, to incentivize colleagues and to get at least some of the papers translated from Spanish into English. Here, Laís Bernstein laid the ground, in both substance and procedure. In 2018, Maria Ana Barata stepped in and organized the process of discussion with the authors in Spanish and Portuguese. The various rounds of debate finally led to a successful outcome. That is why Maria Ana Barata deserves to be the lead author in the introduction. All this would not have sufficed if Christopher Goddard had not brought the mixture of non–native English, German, Portuguese and Spanish into a readable format. Hans–W. Micklitz accompanied conceptualization of the conference and the making of the Special Issue from beginning to end.},

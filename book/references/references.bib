For over 15 years (1990-2006), he served as the Editor-in-Chief for our journal, Plant Protection Science. His whole adult life was connected with agriculture, plant pathology, plant protection and the science of phytotherapy. However, he was also man who accepted, maintained, applied and lived his life following specific, serious traditional rules. The trajectory of his life and its fundamental message arose primarily from his family origins and experiences in youth.",

abstract = {Immunopeptidomic profiling with mass spectrometry has the capacity to directly identify peptide neo-antigens and provide a better understanding of the relationship between oncogenic processes, antigen presentation and immunity. Key to this is the use of search engines for the interpretation of mass spectra acquired after HLA peptide purification and LC-MS. In this study we present a comparison of three commonly used search engines across several immunopeptidomic datasets. We found that choice of search engine influences not only sensitivity but remarkably the repertoire of peptide sequences identified. Using NetMHC we validate our results showing that additional peptides identified are highly likely to be bound to a HLA protein. Based on this we investigate how search engine bias affects the outcome of an immunopeptidomic analyses given a background of different HLA alleles. We look in detail at this effect profiling several tumour samples with diverse HLA types.}

*Welcome to the AGRICOLA subject indexing guidelines*

:::{tip}
*The AGRICOLA subject indexing handbook* is not meant to be read from start to finish. Start with a concept, tool or method that you need now, in your current work. Browse the different guides that make up the book, or use the search box (upper right corner) to search for whatever you would like to learn about first.
